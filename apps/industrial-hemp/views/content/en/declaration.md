I confirm that:

- to the best of my knowledge and belief the information I have given is correct
- the person responsible for regulatory affairs and compliance will discharge all licence responsibilities
- if, in the future, I choose not to renew the licence, I will need to submit this form at the point you cease to hold controlled drugs, and relinquish the licence
- I confirm that statistical returns will be submitted on an annual basis, if applicable (further information about who needs to submit statistical returns is on our website)

I understand that:

- that failing to inform the Secretary of State of material changes to the circumstances of my licence holder identity, site, activity, schedule, individuals named on the form or criminal convictions could affect the validity of my licence
